### Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Deep Learning

* Developed a sentiment analysis model to classify text data into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
  
* Performed data preprocessing, including tokenization, sequence conversion, and padding.

* Utilized Word Embeddings and trained an LSTM-based deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.

* Optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning and early stopping.

* Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving high predictive performance.
